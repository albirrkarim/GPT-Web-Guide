**React GPT Web Guide** Imagine you have an AI that can act as guide in your website.

## Can be used as

Conversational AI

## How It Works

Based on [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes)

Screen Reader (all menus, buttons, form). Understand the user say and do the actions.

Using [Browser SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) so the ai can speak,

and using [React Speech Recognition](https://github.com/JamesBrill/react-speech-recognition) for Speech Recognition.
